Terminal-Based E-Commerce System (Python)
Overview

This project is a simple terminal-based e-commerce application built using Python. It demonstrates core Python programming concepts such as dictionaries, loops, conditionals, user input handling, and basic program flow control. The system allows users to interact with a virtual store through a command-line menu.

Features

Display a menu-driven interface

Add new products to the store

View available products with prices

Add products to a shopping cart

View items currently in the cart

Calculate total cost and checkout

Clear cart after successful checkout

Exit the program gracefully

How the Program Works

The application uses dictionaries to store products and cart items. Users select options by entering numbers corresponding to menu choices. Based on the selected option, the program performs actions such as adding products, viewing items, or completing checkout. The program runs continuously until the user chooses to exit.
